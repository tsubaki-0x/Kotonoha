# School Days HQ v1.02 — documentation index (Kotonoha v3)

**Target:** Windows L4. Android is deferred until Windows is ready. The
School Days implementation is in `games/school-days/`, while generic engine
functionality belongs to `lib/`. This index is navigational, not a claim of
full retail parity or QA completion.

The 11 previously published/tracked documents retain their original paths to
avoid breaking external links. The 18 local, *untracked* dated notes were
grouped into topical folders. Their contents are preserved (except necessary
relative-path updates); these files are **not approved for public Git
publication** merely because this index links to them.

## Do not relocate without updating dependencies

The `src/`, `include/`, `game-assets/`, `display-options/`, `windows/`,
`launcher-art/` and `tests/fixtures/` folders have hardcoded paths in CMake,
runtime code and test harnesses. Moving them requires auditing and updating
all consumers, followed by compilation and CTest. The optional QA tools in
`games/school-days/tools/` and `tools/schooldays_parity/` also embed paths.

Commercial packs, local L×H media, real saves and private translation JSONs
must remain outside the Git history. The `build/` tree contains active L4
builds, backups and junctions to the retail install; never run a blanket
recursive cleanup there.
